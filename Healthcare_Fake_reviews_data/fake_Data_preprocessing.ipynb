This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.\", Label=2)\n",

The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you\\'ve played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time\\'s Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer\\'s work (I haven\\'t heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can\\'t say for sure), and even if you\\'ve never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.', Label=2)\n",

Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross\", Label=2)\n",

And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^\", Label=2)\n"

The finish is flaking off, after less than 6 months of use. It is not worth the struggle to keep up. If you already have it, call the customer service number and order a second chair pad.

It's a beautiful chair and looks great in the kitchen. It's much nicer looking than the 'plastic' ones you see. What I don't like about this chair is the day-to-day functionality of it. It does not adjust, at all. As the baby gets older, I want a chair that tilts, adjusts, etc-- and this does not do that. Also, it is very heavy and hard to move; it does not slide on the floor well at all. The seatbelt is clumsy and a pain to put through the fabric cover when you take the cover on or off for cleaning. After being used multiple times, the velcro that fastens the fabric cover down will no longer stick so every time you lift your child out of the highchair, the cover comes with them. I found myself very frustrated with this chair.I would not recommend this chair to anyone. I do think it's pretty though if you are going strictly by looks!\", Label=1)\n",

Space-wize, they are great; they have a small footprint and look nice along side the rest of our furniture.The 2nd tray and the slide-out cup holders are a great addition to this high chair. The shelf under the seat is a great place to store bibs.The downside of the Eddie Bauer high chair is that its difficult to clean. I have toddler twins, I don't have a lot of time to spend cleaning their high chairs with a toothbrush! The slats on the side of the seat are close together and food gets slopped in between them at every meal. If you don't throughly clean this up after each meal, it dries and is difficult to get clean.Another downside is my kids never really fit well into these highchairs. They were always too short for the tray, and the tray was always too far away as opposed to other highchairs. This helped create even more food mess!\", Label=1)\n",
